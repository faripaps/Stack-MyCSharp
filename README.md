# Stack-MyCSharp

C sharp program

In this example, the program first reads the contents of a text file using File.ReadAllLines, which returns an array of strings representing each line of the file. Then, it creates a stack using Stack<string> and adds each line of the text file to the stack using the Push method. Finally, it uses a while loop to pop each line from the stack and output it using Console.WriteLine.

Make sure to replace "input.txt" with the path to your desired text file.

Note that this program assumes that the text file exists and is accessible.
